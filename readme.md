# Documentation

Follow these steps to benchmark a new (supervised) model. If you want to benchmark something like feature importance or unsupervised learning, you will have to make more substantial changes (mostly in `01_fit_models.py`)

1. Write the sklearn-compliant model (init, fit, predict, predict_proba for classifiers) and add it somewhere in a local folder or in `imodels`
2. Update configs - create a new folder mimicking an existing folder (e.g. `config.interactions`)
   1. Select which datasets you want by modifying `datasets.py` (datasets will be downloaded locally automatically later)
   2. Select which models you want by editing a list similar to `models.py`
3. run `01_fit_models.py`
    - pass the appropriate cmdline args (e.g. model, dataset, config)
    - example command: `python 01_fit_models.py --config interactions --classification_or_regression classification --split_seed 0`
    - another ex.: `python 01_fit_models.py --config interactions --classification_or_regression classification --model randomforest --split_seed 0`
    - running everything: loop over `split_seed` + `classification_or_regression`
    - alternatively, to parallelize over a slurm cluster, run `01_submit_fitting.py` with the appropriate loops
4. run `02_aggregate_results.py` (which just combines the output of `01_run_comparisons.py` into a `combined.pkl` file across datasets) for plotting
5. put scripts/notebooks into a subdirectory of the `notebooks` folder (e.g. `notebooks/interactions`)


## Config
- When running multiple seeds, we want to aggregate over all keys that are not the split_seed
  - If a hyperparameter is not passed in `ModelConfig` (e.g. because we are using parial), it cannot be aggregated over seeds later on
    - The `extra_aggregate_keys={'max_leaf_nodes': n}` is a workaround for this (see configs with `partial` to understand how it works) 


# Testing

Tests are run via `pytest`
